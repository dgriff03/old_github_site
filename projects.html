				C++: This is an example of my C++ code work.
				This is my solution to problems 18 and 67 of Project Euler. 
				These problems are the same in principle but different in scale.
				The basic problem is to intake a triangle of random numbers and 
				find the largest sum possible by going down the tree by the two
				children. The code currently is set to run problem 67. In order to
				run it for problem 18 max_inrow must be set to 15. The problems can be
				found at <a class="noeffect" href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=18">problem 18</a> and 
				<a class="noeffect" href="http://projecteuler.net/problem=67">problem 67</a>
