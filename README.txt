README
The desktop based site is up and running well. The mobile site is not yet there, trying to prevent the need to load the background image.
There could also be improvements made on the image such as link placement.
EDIT: Improvements need to be made to the apperence of the mobile site. Looking into adding another page
that would contain examples of my code in different languages
EDIT 2: The monitor based site is up to par in my opinion. Could use more
on the index page but acceptable. The mobile page is now in diarray as I have
not yet updated the mobile CSS for all the new content and classes
