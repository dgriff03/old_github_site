README
The desktop based site is up and running well. The moble site is not yet there, trying to prevent the need to load the background image.
There could also be improvements made on the image such as link placement.
EDIT: Improvements need to be made to the apperence of the moble site. Looking into adding another page
that would contain examples of my code in different languages
EDIT 2: The monitor based site is up to par in my opinion. Could use more
on the index page but acceptable. The moble page is now in diarray as I have
not yet updated the moble CSS for all the new content and classes
