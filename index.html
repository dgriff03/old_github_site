				<h2>A little about me</h2>
				<p>
					I am currently a student within the Tufts School of Engineering for Computer Science.
					The language my studies have focused in is C++ but I am also currently learning html and css.
					During my time at Tufts, I spent one summer studying in rural France. This trip intensified 
					my desire to explore the world.  I have had the opportunity to visit Rome, London, Jerusalem, 
					Talloires France and many of the United States national parks but I eagerly await the next 
					opportunity for travel.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I am not working I am working on my Emergency Medical Technician certification, scuba
					diving, rock climbing or hiking. My remaining time is dedicated to maintaining my fraternity's
					financial stability as the house Treasurer.
