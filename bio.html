	<div class="textbox"><p>I am currently a student within the Tufts School of Engineering for Computer Science.
	The language my studies have focused in is C++ but I am also currently learning html and css.
	During my time at Tufts, I spent one summer studying in rural France. This trip intensified 
	my desire to explore the world.  I have had the opportunity to visit Rome, London, Jerusalem, 
	Talloires France and many of the United States national parks but I eagerly await the next 
	opportunity for travel. </p>
	<p>	When I am not working I am working on my Emergency Medical Technician certification, scuba
	diving, rock climbing or hiking. My remaining time is dedicated to maintaining my fraternity's
	financial stability as the house Treasurer. </P></div>
