	<p>I was raised in Belmont Massachusetts. When I started my studies at tufts university I was interested<br/>
	in mechanical engineering as I enjoy working with my hands. This led me to join the Tufts Hybrid Racing team.<br/>
	Soon I found computer science and found the work more enjoyable so I switched my major. This puts me in a<br/>
	long line of family members working within the computer science world.</p>
